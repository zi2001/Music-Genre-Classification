## Overview
This project aims to classify music genres using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is trained on audio features extracted from music tracks, specifically spectrograms and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in genre classification.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle competition. It includes approximately 10,000 songs spanning 10 different genres, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating the model.

## Features
- **Spectrograms:** Visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound sample.
- **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients):** Coefficients that collectively make up an MFC, representing the short-term power spectrum of a sound.

## Model
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A deep learning model used for image recognition tasks, adapted here for audio signal processing.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the model.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Libraries used for building and training the CNN.
- **Librosa**: Python package for music and audio analysis, used for feature extraction.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Used for model deployment.
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerization and deployment.

## Deployment
- **End-to-End Solution**: Built an API for seamless integration.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Deployed the model on GCP for scalability and reliability.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Created a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for an intuitive experience.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization to ensure consistent and scalable deployment.
